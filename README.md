As US high school students, we are committed to improving the education systems within our country. We want to make sure students from all across the nation have access to educational resources that enable them to develop into the leaders and innovators of the future. Due to real-world funding limitations for school programs and resources, it is imperative for educational institutions to better understand how they can effectively distribute funding for various educational categories which include but are not limited to transportation, community service programs, tech supplies, instructional support, academic programs, general and school administration, instructional staff, food services, and more. Through OptiFind, we are working towards providing insights for school counties to provide high quality education for students across the nation.
